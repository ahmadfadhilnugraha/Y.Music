# Y.Music
As an analyst at Y.Music Company, I test some hypothesis to compare user's preference.

Every time we conduct research, we need to formulate a hypothesis that we could test. Sometimes we accept this hypothesis, but sometimes we also reject it. To generate informed decisions, a business must be able to understand whether its assumptions are true or not.

In this project, I will compare music preferences in the cities of Springfield and Shelbyville. You will learn from the actual Y.Music data to test the following hypothesis and compare user behavior in both cities.

## Goals
Testing three hypothesis:

1. Users activity varies depending on the day and the city.
2. On Monday morning, residents of Springfield and Shelbyville listen to different genres. This also valid to Friday night.
3. Users in Springfield and Shelbyville have different preferences. In Springfield, they prefer pop music, while in Shelbyville, rap music has more fans.

## Steps
The data related to users behavior is stored in the file /datasets/music_project_en.csv. There is no information available regarding the quality of the data, therefore it is necessary to first examine it before testing any hypotheses.

Firstly, I will evaluate the data quality and determine if there any issues are significant. Then, during the data pre-processing stage, I will attempt to address the most serious problems.

This projects will consist of 3 steps:

1. Data Overview
2. Preprocessing Data
3. Testing the Hypothesis
